    "description": "Hello, I'm Murali Krishna, a UX/UI Designer by profession and a creative problem-solver by passion. My journey began with a background in mechanical engineering, but my interest in design grew stronger after preparing for the CEED exam at IIT Bombay in 2019â€“2020. That experience sparked my transition into the design field. I started my career as a freelance UI Designer at Thryakshari Software Solutions, where I applied design principles to real-world projects and built a strong foundation. In November 2021, I joined Qentelli Solutions in Hyderabad, focusing on Customer Experience (CX) design, where I refined my understanding of user behavior and empathy-driven design. I also completed a certification from the Interaction Design Foundation to further strengthen my skills. Due to challenges in the job market, I took a brief career break, during which I returned to freelancing. Although I faced several difficulties initially, this period gave me valuable hands-on experience and boosted my confidence as I handled projects from start to finish. In November 2024, I joined Invest4Edu in Hyderabad as a UX/UI Designer, where I currently work on transforming products into intuitive, user-focused solutions that align with business goals. My journey has been fueled by a constant drive to learn, adapt, and contribute to meaningful design experiences."
